# [Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Node.js is an runtime environment for developing server-side applications written in JavaScript.
It provides an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking I/O API designed
to optimize an application's throughput and scalability for real-time web applications.
