# Meteor

Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript platform for developing modern web and mobile applications. Meteor includes a key set of technologies for building connected-client reactive applications, a build tool, and a curated set of packages from the Node.js and general JavaScript community.

* Meteor allows you to develop in one language, JavaScript, in all environments: application server, web browser, and mobile device.

* Meteor uses data on the wire, meaning the server sends data, not HTML, and the client renders it.

* Meteor embraces the ecosystem, bringing the best parts of the extremely active JavaScript community to you in a careful and considered way.

* Meteor provides full stack reactivity, allowing your UI to seamlessly reflect the true state of the world with minimal development effort.
